# City Simulation Game

This is a city management simulation game where players control a city’s growth, economy, and infrastructure while managing population, income, power supply, and natural disasters. Players can build various structures like schools, hospitals, houses, and renewable energy plants to influence the city's development.

## Features
- **Population Growth**: Balance birth rate, death rate, and migration to grow your population.
- **Income Management**: Set tax rates and manage power supply to maintain income.
- **Building Construction**: Build schools, hospitals, houses, and renewable energy plants.
- **Charts & Graphs**: Real-time charts for population and income tracking.
- **Natural Disasters**: Random events like floods, earthquakes, and wars affect the city's growth.
- **Activity Log**: To track changes and events in the city.
- **Highlight**: Helps notice small changes, which aren't shown in the activity log, immediately.

## How to Play
These rules are available to the player during the game as well if they click the 'How to Play' button. They can then exit that view by either pressing the close button or clicking outside of the box.

1. **Adjust Tax Rate**: Use the slider to set your city’s tax rate.
2. **Build Structures**: Click on the buttons to build schools, hospitals, houses, or energy plants. Each structure has different effects on your city.
3. **Watch Growth**: Monitor your city’s population, income, power supply, and other metrics.
4. **Survive Natural Disasters**: Be ready for natural disasters that can affect your city’s progress.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends if the population or income drops too low.

## Calculations
Running a city has many factors and some are reflected in the game. Building houses will increase teh population directly while building a school will increase birthrate and hospitals will decrease deathrate so indirectly both contribute to population growth. However to balance the increase in power demand which all three structures bring renewable energy plants need to be built which provide an environment friendly source of energy. Migration rate is influenced mainly by the tax rate: when taxes are high the migration rate is lower but if taxes drop then the migration rate will increase.
